# BetterTogether_Youngeretal2023

All scripts used to analyze Project iLEAD data as described in Younger et al., 2023 10.3389/fnhum.2023.1195013 are available for replication purposes. 
Scripts are organized into the 'Scripts' folder, with additional functions called within these scripts are within the 'Functions' folder. 

# Set Up
1. Download/clone this repo to work with files locally
2. Within the project directory, create a 'Results' folder with the following subfolders: "CFA_Models", "CommunityDetectionResults", and "ResamplingResults". Scripts have been set up to save outputs of results to these folders and may result in error if the folder cannot be found
3. The first time working with a script, change the path to the working directory for the project (located near the beginning of the script)
4. No additional edits should be required to run the scripts to replicate the results described in Younger et al 2023

# Notes
Once data are made publically available, raw data and data dictionaries will be added to this repo
